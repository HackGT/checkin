# Check-ins!!!

Throwing a hackathon? Have hackers? Want to keep track of who shows up?
Well this is the app for you!

NOTE: this is basically just a front-end Angular.js app that offers a new
interface geared entirely for checking in attendees. The backend is entirely
separate. This application assumes a backend that is (or compliant with the
API of) HackMIT's (as-of-this-writing still closed source) hacker application
and registration system.
